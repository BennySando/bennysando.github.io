        <p name="about" id="about" class="about">
            I'm from Friendswood, Texas, a town right in between Houston and Galveston. I graduated from Clear Springs High School and am 
            currently enrolled at the University of Texas at Austin as a computer science major. I built (and am currently working on) this website
            as a way to develop and hone my abillities with HTML, CSS, and, hopefully, a good bit of JavaScript. If you want to see something more interesting
            than a self-introduction, check below for pathways to other neat things like my resume or some projects.

                My first online project, and a remake of <a href="https://studio.code.org/projects/applab/JWkGEzif6XmZXZP10khABr2OnNV2D8Qa0TYbpq0S8Rw">
                an older project</a> I made on <a href="https://code.org/">code.org</a> back during my junior year of high school. This time, it 
                features improvements such as much better design, base stats, promotions, level tracking, and more. This project 
                helped me hone my skills with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and also taught me what a JSON file is. Right now, everything functions
                as it should, but I still have some updates I would like to make.
