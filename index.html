        <h1>Hello, I'm Benjamin Sandoval</h1>
        <h2>Thanks for checking out my website, by the way</h2>
        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>
            I'm from Friendswood, Texas, a town right in between Houston and Galveston. I graduated from Clear Springs High School and am 
            currently enrolled at the University of Texas at Austin as a computer science major. I built (and am currently working on) this website
            as a way to develop and hone my abillities with HTML, CSS, and, hopefully, a good bit of JavaScript. If you want to see something more interesting
            than a self-introduction, check below for pathways to other neat things like my resume or some projects.
